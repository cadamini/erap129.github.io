My name is Elad Rapaport. I completed a B.Sc in Software Engineering in Ben Gurion University, and currently a second year Master's student in the department of Information Systems Engineering, and a research student at Cyber@BGU.  
I am interested in all forms of data science, and especially signal data processing such as images, sound, or network traffic data. I enjoy data exploration and the creation and deployment of algorithms such as deep neural networks, for various tasks.
